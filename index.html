            <!-- Overview Section -->
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              While working as an instructional designer at Chi-Chack LLC, I
              noticed an opportunity to improve their existing customer service
              training, which was primarily video-based and time-consuming.
              After a conversation with a senior customer service rep, I
              volunteered to create a more efficient, scenario-driven eLearning
              course. This resulted in a self-paced model that uses real-life
              scenarios, helping associates build the skills they need in a
              fraction of the time.
            </p>

            <!-- Action Map Section -->
            <h4>Action Map</h4>
            <p>
              Collaborating closely with the senior SME, we built an action map
              to identify five key customer service behaviors that separate
              great customer service from good or standard service. These
              behaviors included not just de-escalating and escalating customer
              issues properly, but also going the extra mile in problem
              resolution, anticipating customer needs, and delivering
              personalized experiences. These critical actions formed the
              backbone of the course design, ensuring that every scenario
              demonstrated how to elevate performance from satisfactory to
              exceptional, aligned with real-world customer interactions.
            </p>

            <!-- Full Development Section -->
            <h4>Full Development</h4>
            <p>
              The project followed the ADDIE model, involving constant
              collaboration with the SME and feedback from customer service
              teams. I oversaw all phases, from analysis through to evaluation,
              ensuring the course met business goals while keeping learners
              engaged.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Worked with SMEs to pinpoint five key customer service skills
                necessary for better job performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Designed and storyboarded scenarios that mirrored real-life
                customer interactions to make the training as relevant as
                possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed the course in Articulate Storyline, integrating
                quizzes, interactive videos, and audio narration to enhance
                engagement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Performed multiple rounds of user testing and iterations to
                refine content and improve the overall learning experience.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Storyboarding Section -->
            <h4>Storyboarding</h4>
            <p>
              I developed a text-based storyboard that utilized the five
              critical actions from the action map. These actions were built
              into branching scenarios, with the correct answers as key actions
              and common mistakes as distractors. I worked closely with the SME
              to ensure each decision had realistic consequences, ensuring the
              training reflected real-life customer service interactions.
            </p>

            <!-- Visual Mockups Section -->
            <h4>Visual Mockups</h4>
            <p>
              After storyboarding was approved, I moved to visual design using
              Adobe XD, crafting a clean, branded interface. I designed custom
              elements like progress bars and navigation buttons, ensuring
              consistency with the company’s style guide.
            </p>

            <!-- Interactive Prototype Section -->
            <h4>Interactive Prototype</h4>
            <p>
              Before final development, I created an interactive prototype in
              Articulate Storyline. This allowed us to test the flow and
              functionality of the course, particularly focusing on the first
              two scenarios. Based on feedback, I made several adjustments to
              improve usability and engagement.
            </p>

            <!-- Results Section -->
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>
              The course boosted learner engagement by 40%, with LMS data
              reflecting high interaction rates. Post-training surveys revealed
              a 25% improvement in customer satisfaction scores, and associates
              reported feeling more confident in resolving complex customer
              issues. This led to a noticeable reduction in escalations and an
              improvement in overall customer retention.
            </p>

            <!-- Takeaways Section -->
            <h4>Takeaways</h4>
            <p>
              This project reinforced the value of scenario-based learning,
              showing me firsthand how connecting training to real-world
              situations can significantly boost both learner engagement and
              business outcomes. By focusing on what truly makes customer
              service exceptional, and integrating those behaviors into
              realistic, relatable scenarios, I learned how powerful hands-on
              learning can be. I also gained a deeper understanding of how
              aligning the training content with core business challenges, like
              improving customer satisfaction and reducing escalations, can

            I developed VoiceReal in response to a significant gap in language
            learning tools—there were no specialized apps that combined multiple
            languages in one platform specifically designed to help learners
            boost their reading and listening skills, especially those in the
            initial stages of language acquisition. As part of a larger proposal
            writing and marketing strategy, VoiceReal was created to showcase
            how technology can play a transformative role in language learning,
            supporting students at the University of Montana’s Defense Critical
            Language and Culture Program (DCLCP).

          <!-- Process Section -->
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, including
              language instructors, students, and managers, to define the app's
              core features and functionalities. This involved gathering diverse
              input to ensure the app met both instructional goals and learner
              needs. Through multiple brainstorming sessions and feedback loops,
              we identified essential elements like real-time text-to-speech,
              multi-language support, and a user-friendly interface.
            </li>
            <li>
              The app's development was built on a foundation of JavaScript,
              CSS, and HTML, which I used to program its structure and behavior.
              Integrating real-time text-to-speech functionalities via external
              APIs was a technical challenge, but it was essential for providing
              a seamless, interactive experience for users learning multiple
              languages. This experience deepened my understanding of API
              integration and its role in enhancing user interaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Throughout the design process, I worked closely with stakeholders,
              continuously refining the app’s interface to ensure it was
              intuitive and user-friendly. The app had to accommodate users with
              varying tech skills, so it was critical to design an interface
              that was simple yet robust. At the same time, supporting multiple
              languages presented challenges in terms of layout and
              functionality, which required creative solutions to ensure a
              smooth user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              I had the opportunity to present the app at a national conference,
              highlighting its innovative approach to language learning. This
              presentation not only demonstrated the app’s capabilities but also
              illustrated its potential to enhance language acquisition. The
              positive reception led to securing additional grant funding for
              the University of Montana’s DCLCP, enabling further development
              and expansion of the project.
