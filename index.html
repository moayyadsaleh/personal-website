            <!-- Overview Section -->
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              As Chi-Chack LLC's language instructional designer, I recognized
              an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of their existing
              customer service training, which was time-consuming and largely
              video-based. After a conversation with a senior customer service
              representative, I offered to develop a more streamlined,
              scenario-based eLearning course that could deliver real impact in
              less time. This resulted in a self-paced training program that
              used real-world scenarios to help associates master key customer
              service skills efficiently.
            </p>

            <!-- Action Map Section -->
            <h4>Action Map</h4>
            <p>
              To guide the development of this course, I collaborated with the
              senior SME to create an action map. This helped pinpoint five
              critical actions that associates needed to improve on, such as
              resolving customer complaints, de-escalating situations, and
              properly escalating cases. These actions formed the foundation of
              the eLearning course, ensuring that every scenario was tied to
              real-world applications that aligned with business objectives.
            </p>

            <!-- Full Development Section -->
            <h4>Full Development</h4>
            <p>
              Developing this course required continuous collaboration with the
              SME and feedback from the customer service team. I followed the
              ADDIE model throughout the project, starting with analysis and
              working through design, development, implementation, and
              evaluation.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Collaborated with SMEs to identify the five critical customer
                service actions required to improve job performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Created a storyboard and developed visual mockups to refine the
                course layout and flow, ensuring alignment with the company’s
                brand.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed the course using Articulate Storyline, combining
                multimedia elements like interactive quizzes, videos, and audio
                narration to ensure learner engagement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Conducted iterative testing with user groups to improve content
                based on feedback.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Storyboarding Section -->
            <h4>Storyboarding</h4>
            <p>
              I developed a text-based storyboard that utilized the five
              critical actions from the action map. These actions were built
              into branching scenarios, with the correct answers as key actions
              and common mistakes as distractors. I worked closely with the SME
              to ensure each decision had realistic consequences, ensuring the
              training reflected real-life customer service interactions.
            </p>

            <!-- Visual Mockups Section -->
            <h4>Visual Mockups</h4>
            <p>
              After receiving approval on the storyboard, I moved to the visual
              design phase. Using Adobe XD, I developed mockups of the course,
              including custom progress bars, buttons, and character design. The
              visuals aligned with the company’s branding and offered a clean,
              professional interface. This step was crucial in allowing for
              early feedback before full development began in Articulate
              Storyline.
            </p>

            <!-- Interactive Prototype Section -->
            <h4>Interactive Prototype</h4>
            <p>
              Before moving into full development, I created an interactive
              prototype in Articulate Storyline, focusing on the first two
              scenarios. This allowed me to test the course’s functionality,
              including custom animations and branching scenarios, gathering
              feedback from the SME and adjusting based on user interaction.
            </p>

            <!-- Results Section -->
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>
              The course increased learner engagement by 40%, with LMS tracking
              showing high interaction rates. Post-training feedback indicated a
              25% improvement in customer satisfaction, and new associates
              reported feeling more confident in handling difficult customer
              interactions. This contributed to a measurable improvement in
              customer retention and reduced escalations.
            </p>

            <!-- Takeaways Section -->
            <h4>Takeaways</h4>
            <p>
              This project demonstrated the importance of scenario-based
              learning and how aligning training with real-world tasks can drive
              both learner engagement and business results. By focusing on core
              performance challenges and integrating them into the course
              design, I was able to deliver a solution that met both the
              learner’s needs and the company’s objectives.

          <!-- Overview Section -->
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            I coded and programmed this app to support online language
            instruction by addressing the need for interactivity, especially for
            those learning a new language. Before this app, instructors often
            asked students to buy keyboard alphabet stickers and manually
            install their target language on devices to practice writing. I
            volunteered to develop a solution that combined all the keyboards in
            one place, making it easier for learners to access and practice
            multiple languages. Working with cross-functional teams and
            students, I iterated and refined the app through extensive testing.
          </p>

          <!-- Full Development Section -->
          <h4>Full Development</h4>
          <p>
            This project was built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, with the
            Canvas API integrated to enable drawing and erasing functionality.
            The tool's interface was designed to be intuitive and simple while
            supporting complex functionalities like multilingual input,
            adjustable layouts, and a no-authentication-required model to keep
            the user experience seamless.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked closely with instructors and students during the design and
            testing phases to ensure the app met educational needs. The project
            went through several iterations to improve accessibility and
            responsiveness. Feedback from users helped refine the interactive
            elements, making the tool more user-friendly and adaptable.
          </p>
