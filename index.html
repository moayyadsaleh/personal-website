            <!-- Overview Section -->
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              While working as an instructional designer at Chi-Chack LLC, I had a conversation with one of the senior customer service representatives. They shared that some associates were struggling with customer interactions, especially when things got complicated. I volunteered to design and develop a self-paced e-learning course to help the team out. The result was an interactive, scenario-based training that equips new associates with the skills they need to deliver exceptional customer service.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Full Development Section -->
            <h4>Full Development</h4>
            <p>
              I worked closely with a senior customer service SME to ensure the training content addressed real challenges the associates were facing. Following the ADDIE model, I designed, developed, and refined the course through several iterations, using feedback from stakeholders to make sure it hit the mark. The course includes a mix of videos, audio, and interactive quizzes, all built in Articulate Storyline.
            </p>
            <p>
              The content was continuously refined to improve learner engagement and effectiveness. The combination of multimedia and scenario-based interactions made the course engaging and directly applicable to the job.
            </p>
    
            <!-- Action Maps Section -->
            <h4>Action Maps</h4>
            <p>
              By applying Cathy Moore’s Action Mapping, I made sure the course was directly tied to the performance gaps we wanted to close. We built scenarios around handling upset customers, resolving complex issues, and escalating cases properly. This gave learners a chance to practice those key skills and feel more confident when dealing with difficult situations.
            </p>
    
            <!-- Process Section -->
            <h4>Process</h4>

          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            The Virtual Keyboard project was developed to create a robust, user-friendly tool with flexible language support and interactive features like drawing and erasing. Inspired by the Canva interface, this project allows users to engage with the keyboard in versatile ways, such as creating multilingual text input, drawing directly on the interface, and clearing or resetting their inputs easily.

          <!-- Full Development Section -->
          <h4>Full Development</h4>
          <p>
            This project was built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, with the Canvas API integrated to enable drawing and erasing functionality. The tool's interface was designed to be intuitive and simple while supporting complex functionalities like multilingual input, adjustable layout, and a no-authentication-required model to keep the user experience seamless.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project went through several iterations of design to ensure that it met accessibility and responsiveness standards. I collaborated with testers to gather feedback, particularly on how users engaged with the interactive elements, and made refinements to improve usability.

          <h4>Action Maps</h4>
          <p>
            While this project was more technical in nature, I still applied principles of user-centered design. I mapped out the essential features that would directly impact user satisfaction, such as the ability to switch between languages seamlessly, interactive drawing and erasing, and responsive design to ensure the tool worked on both desktop and mobile devices.

          <!-- Process Section -->
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Defined the key functionalities, such as drawing, erasing, and supporting multiple languages, to enhance the versatility of the keyboard.</li>
            <li>Developed the tool using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, with extensive use of the Canvas API to handle drawing features.</li>
            <li>Designed the UI to mimic the clean, intuitive style of Canva, focusing on simplicity and interactivity.</li>
            <li>Tested the tool on various devices to ensure responsiveness and ease of use across different platforms.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Results</h4>
          <p>
            The virtual keyboard project received positive feedback for its flexibility and ease of use. It was particularly appreciated for its multilingual support and the ability to interact with the keyboard beyond typical text input. The responsive design ensured that users could easily switch between devices without losing functionality.

          <h4>Takeaways</h4>
          <p>
            This project demonstrated the importance of building responsive, accessible tools that meet user needs in an intuitive way. The integration of interactive features like drawing and erasing allowed for greater flexibility, and it reinforced the need to focus on both functionality and user experience when developing technical solutions.
