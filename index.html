                engaging, and learner-focused. I did everything right within
                PowerPointâ€”no third-party video editing tools. The video you see
                is the actual PowerPoint presentation, just in slideshow mode.

              <!-- Overview Section -->
              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>
                I started with outdated, text-heavy PowerPoint slides that were
                cluttered, overwhelming, and difficult to follow. My goal was to
                transform them into sleek, modern, and visually engaging
                presentations. I aimed to create slides that felt fresh and were
                easier to understand by applying techniques such as the "rule of
                three," chunking, dual coding theory, and effective use of white
                space and negative space to maintain clarity and organization.
              </p>

              <!-- Full Development Section -->
              <h4>Full Development</h4>
              <p>
                As a strategic thinker, I saw each slide as a chance to balance
                good content with strong visual appeal. I asked myself a few key
                questions for each slide:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Whatâ€™s the main message here?</li>
                <li>
                  How can I present this information in a way thatâ€™s easy to
                  digest?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How can animations and transitions help guide the viewerâ€™s
                  focus without being distracting?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                For each slide, I applied principles from cognitive load theory
                to ensure clarity and ease of understanding. I broke down
                complex information into smaller chunks (Segmenting Principle)
                and paired concise text with meaningful visuals (Multimedia
                Principle) to enhance comprehension. I avoided adding extraneous
                graphics, sounds, or text that could distract from the core
                message (Coherence Principle) and ensured related text and
                visuals were placed close together for easy processing (Spatial
                Contiguity Principle). I also highlighted essential points using
                cues like bold text, arrows, or color contrasts to direct the
                audience's attention (Signaling Principle) while maintaining
                simplicity to prevent cognitive overload.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it came to animations and transitions, I kept them simple
                and professional. The goal was to keep the content flowing
                smoothly and subtly highlight key points to guide the learnerâ€™s
                attention.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also spent time experimenting with different layouts, color
                schemes, and typography to make sure all slides looked polished
                and cohesive. This wasnâ€™t just about making it prettyâ€”it was
                about making sure every slide served a purpose and contributed
                to an engaging, learner-centered experience.
              </p>

              <!-- Results Section -->
              <h4>Results</h4>
              <p>
                The new design made a huge difference. By applying principles of
                visual design and cognitive load theory, the slides:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Boosted engagement:</strong> Clean layouts, good color
                  choices, and subtle animations helped keep viewersâ€™ attention
                  and made the experience more immersive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Improved understanding:</strong> Chunking the content
                  and using design strategies based on Mayer's principles helped
                  reduce cognitive overload and made the slides easier to
                  follow.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Increased presenter confidence:</strong> When the
                  slides look good and are easy to present, it boosts the
                  confidence of the presenter too, making it easier to deliver a
                  clear message.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Research backs this upâ€”studies show that visuals designed with
                purpose can improve learning outcomes by up to 50% compared to
                text-heavy slides (Clark & Mayer, 2016). This transformation
                really shows how effective design can improve both communication
                and learning.

              <h4>Takeaways</h4>
              <p>
                This project taught me a lot about both design and instructional
                strategy. Here are some of the key takeaways:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>User-focused design is crucial:</strong> Itâ€™s
                  important to think from both the learnerâ€™s and the presenterâ€™s
                  perspective to create something that works for everyone.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Balancing style with function:</strong> Making slides
                  look great is important, but clarity and relevance should
                  always come first to improve learning.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mastering cognitive load:</strong> Using principles
                  like chunking and dual-channel processing helped me design
                  content thatâ€™s both engaging and easy to understand.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The power of iteration:</strong> Going through
                  multiple design iterations helped me fine-tune everything and
                  get the final product just right.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Design with purpose:</strong> Every design
                  choiceâ€”whether itâ€™s a color, a transition, or a layoutâ€”needs
                  to be made thoughtfully to ensure it contributes to the
                  overall experience.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                All in all, this project showed me the importance of using
                instructional design theories and best practices to create
                materials that are not only eye-catching but also effective in
                helping people learn.

          I worked on designing and developing this course thatâ€™s both
          interactive and engaging using Articulate Storyline, all while
          applying adult learning principles. The goal was to make sure learners
          didnâ€™t just get information but were actively involved in learning
          through real-life scenarios and multimedia elements.

            <strong>Audience:</strong> This course was designed for customer
            service reps, especially those in entry- to associate-level
            positions. The focus was on teaching them how to confidently handle
            customer issues, from basic inquiries to complex complaints.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Responsibilities:</strong> My role covered everything from
            instructional design and e-learning development to visual design,
            storyboarding, and collaborating with subject matter experts (SMEs).
            I was deeply involved in creating the entire learning experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Tools Used:</strong> I used Articulate Storyline, Adobe
            Photoshop for visuals, Audacity for audio editing, Vyond for
            animation, and Moodle for tracking the learnerâ€™s progress. I also
            used Google Docs for collaborating on storyboards and Microsoft
            PowerPoint for initial design mockups.
          </p>

          <!-- Overview Section -->
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            While working at Chi-Chack LLC, I noticed the existing customer
            service training was a bit outdated. It relied too much on passive
            video content, and I saw an opportunity to redesign it into
            something more interactive. After speaking with a senior customer
            service representative, I decided to step up and design a more
            engaging self-paced eLearning model. The new course used realistic,
            scenario-based learning to teach associates how to handle customer
            issues more effectively and efficiently.
          </p>

          <!-- Action Map Section -->
          <h4>Action Map</h4>
          <p>
            Together with the SME, we mapped out the most important customer
            service behaviors reps need to succeed. We focused on five key
            actions that are critical to great customer service, like how to
            handle escalations, how to creatively solve problems, and how to
            provide personalized service. These actions became the backbone of
            the course, ensuring every scenario reflected a real-world customer
            service interaction.
          </p>

          <!-- Full Development Section -->
          <h4>Full Development</h4>
          <p>
            The development process followed the ADDIE model, so I was involved
            from start to finishâ€”designing, building, testing, and refining the
            course. Throughout the process, I worked closely with the SME and
            the customer service team to make sure the course aligned with both
            business goals and the needs of the learners.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Worked with SMEs to pinpoint the key customer service behaviors
              that would make a real difference in performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed and storyboarded interactive, branching scenarios to
              teach those behaviors in a way that felt like real customer
              interactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built the course in Articulate Storyline, incorporating quizzes,
              videos, and voiceovers to keep learners engaged.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tested the course with real learners and adjusted based on
              feedback to make sure it was both engaging and effective.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <!-- Storyboarding Section -->
          <h4>Storyboarding</h4>
          <p>
            The first step was creating a detailed storyboard. This laid out
            everything from the text and questions to the multimedia elements
            for each scenario. The goal was to make sure learners could interact
            with the content, make decisions, and see the consequences of those
            decisions in a way that mimicked real-life customer service
            situations.
          </p>

          <!-- Visual Mockups Section -->
          <h4>Visual Mockups</h4>
          <p>
            Once the storyboard was approved, I moved on to designing the look
            and feel of the course. I created mockups using Adobe XD, ensuring
            that everythingâ€”from the progress bars to the navigation buttonsâ€”was
            user-friendly and aligned with the companyâ€™s branding guidelines.
          </p>

          <!-- Interactive Prototype Section -->
          <h4>Interactive Prototype</h4>
          <p>
            Before jumping into full development, I created a clickable
            prototype in Storyline. This allowed me to test the user experience,
            make sure the scenarios flowed well, and ensure that all the
            interactive elements worked as expected.
          </p>

          <!-- Results Section -->
          <h4>Results</h4>
          <p>
            After launching the course, we saw impressive results. Learner
            engagement increased by 40%, with the course being much more
            interactive than the previous training. Post-training surveys also
            showed a 25% improvement in customer satisfaction scores, and there
            was a noticeable drop in escalations. Associates felt more confident
            handling customer issues on their own, and customer retention
            improved as a result.
          </p>

          <!-- Takeaways Section -->
          <h4>Takeaways</h4>
          <p>
            One of the biggest lessons I learned from this project was the power
            of scenario-based learning. Itâ€™s amazing how real-life, practical
            situations can help learners not only retain information but also
            improve their actual performance on the job. This experience showed
            me how important it is to design training that ties directly into
            real-world business goals and learner needs, and it really
            highlighted the value of collaboration with SMEs to get it right.

          <p>
            I created VoiceReal because I saw a major gap in language learning
            toolsâ€”there just weren't any apps that combined multiple languages
            in one place, specifically designed to help learners improve their
            reading and listening skills. This app was also part of a larger
            proposal for the University of Montanaâ€™s Defense Critical Language
            and Culture Program (DCLCP), showcasing how tech can transform
            language learning for students.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Web development, API integration,
            JavaScript/CSS/HTML programming, collaboration with cross-functional
            teams, conference presentations, and grant writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Tools I used:</strong> JavaScript, CSS, HTML, API
            integration for text-to-speech, GitHub for version control.
          </p>
          <!-- Process Section -->
          <h4>How It Came Together</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I worked closely with a team that included language instructors,
              students, and managers to define what the app's core features. We
              made sure it met the goals of both the teachers and the learners,
              identifying key features like real-time text-to-speech,
              multi-language support, and an easy-to-use interface.
            </li>
            <li>
              Building the app was a challenge, but in a good way. I used
              JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to structure and program the app, then
              integrated text-to-speech functionality through APIs. This was a
              great learning experience, and it showed me how APIs can enhance
              user interactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the design phase, I made sure to keep the app simple, yet
              powerful, so it could be used by anyone, no matter their tech
              skills. I also had to overcome challenges around supporting
              multiple languages, but with some creativity, I got it right.
            </li>
            <li>
              I had the chance to present the app at a national conference
              hosted by the University of Montana's Defense Critical Language
              and Culture Program(DCLCP), and the reception was amazing. The
              presentation helped secure additional funding for the University
              of Montanaâ€™s DCLCP, allowing us to further develop and grow the
              program.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <!-- Results Section -->
          <h4>Results</h4>
          <p>
            VoiceReal among others helped securing extra funding for the
            Universityâ€™s language program. The app continues to help students,
            especially those in the early stages of language learning, improve
            their reading and listening skills. Teachers are using it in the
            classroom, making it an essential tool for language acquisition.
          </p>

          <!-- Takeaways Section -->
          <h4>Takeaways</h4>
          <p>
            Building VoiceReal was a pivotal experience. It showed me how
            technology can really change the game in language learning. I got to
            mix my technical skills with my knowledge of instructional design,
            and it taught me the importance of making learning tools that are
            flexible and user-friendly. Working with a cross-functional team
            also reinforced the value of clear communication and collaboration.
            Above all, I learned the importance of staying agileâ€”constantly
            gathering feedback and iterating to keep up with learnersâ€™ evolving
            needs. Additionally, I wrote custom code to optimize the user
            interface and integrate dynamic features, such as responsive design,
            coding and programming and combing different programming languages
            to create a full-fledged interactive app, which taught me how to
            merge technical expertise with pedagogy effectively. Above all, I
            learned the importance of staying agileâ€”constantly gathering
            feedback and iterating to adapt to learnersâ€™ evolving needs. This
            project reinforced my belief that well-designed educational
            technology, powered by thoughtful programming, can create powerful
            learning experiences that truly make an impact.

          <!-- Overview Section -->
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            This project came about to solve a specific problem in the
            University of Montana's Defense Critical Language and Culture
            Program (DCLCP). Language instructors were often asking students to
            buy alphabet stickers or manually install keyboards for their target
            languages. This process was clunky and time-consuming. So, I stepped
            in to create a tool that put everything in one place, allowing
            students to easily switch between languages and practice writing
            without the hassle.
          </p>

          <!-- Full Development Section -->
          <h4>Full Development</h4>
          <p>
            I built the app using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, incorporating the
            Canvas API for the drawing and erasing features. The goal was to
            design a simple, intuitive interface that could handle complex
            functions like multilingual input and customizable layouts, all
            without requiring authentication. I also made sure it worked
            seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the development process, I worked closely with
            instructors and students to make sure the app met their needs. With
            each round of feedback, I made improvements to the appâ€™s
            interactivity, responsiveness, and overall user experience.
          </p>

          <!-- Action Maps Section -->
          <h4>Action Maps</h4>
          <p>
            Although this project was technically challenging, I focused on
            creating a user-friendly tool that would have a real impact on the
            learning process. The key featuresâ€”such as easy language switching,
            interactive drawing/erasing, and responsive design for different
            devicesâ€”helped ensure the app was both practical and versatile.
          </p>

          <!-- Process Section -->
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I started by figuring out the core features needed for the app:
              drawing, erasing, and multilingual support to make it as flexible
              as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              The app was developed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, with the
              Canvas API for interactive drawing features.
            </li>
            <li>
              I designed the UI to resemble the clean, user-friendly style of
              Canva, keeping things simple but still functional.
            </li>
            <li>
              I tested the app on various devices to make sure it was responsive
              and worked smoothly across desktop and mobile.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <!-- Results Section -->
          <h4>Results</h4>
          <p>
            The virtual keyboard was a hit, especially with students just
            starting out in language learning. It saved them from needing to
            install extra software or use external keyboards. Instructors in the
            DCLCP also found it valuable, incorporating it into their classrooms
            for reading and writing exercises. The feedback was overwhelmingly
            positive, with both students and instructors praising how easy and
            effective it was.
          </p>

          <!-- Takeaways Section -->
          <h4>Takeaways</h4>
          <p>
            This project really highlighted the importance of building tools
            that are both accessible and responsive to real user needs. Adding
            interactive features like drawing and erasing helped make the app
            even more engaging, while the flexibility of the design made it
            useful in both individual and classroom settings. Most importantly,
            it reinforced my belief that educational tools need to be intuitive,
            user-friendly, and adaptable to meet diverse learning needs.
