            <p>
              In this self-initiated project, I transformed outdated, content-heavy PowerPoint slides into a modern, visually appealing design. By applying cognitive load theory, chunking, and instructional design best practices, I improved the experience for both viewers and presenters, minimized cognitive overload, and exported the final presentation as a video.

                <strong>Audience:</strong> Instructional designers and corporate teams seeking to transform outdated, content-heavy presentations into modern, visually engaging materials. The same design techniques can be applied to instructor-led courses, both in-person and online, as well as self-paced learning modules.

              <p>
                <strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Remodeling, transforming, and polishing outdated PowerPoint slides to create visually appealing, learner-centered presentations. All transitions are done through PowerPoint, with no third-party video editing. The content shown in the video is the actual PowerPoint presentation as it appears in slideshow mode.

            <!-- Overview Section -->
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              While working as an instructional designer at Chi-Chack LLC, I
              noticed an opportunity to improve their existing customer service
              training, which was primarily video-based and time-consuming.
              After a conversation with a senior customer service rep, I
              volunteered to create a more efficient, scenario-driven eLearning
              course. This resulted in a self-paced model that uses real-life
              scenarios, helping associates build the skills they need in a
              fraction of the time.
            </p>

            <!-- Action Map Section -->
            <h4>Action Map</h4>
            <p>
              Collaborating closely with the senior SME, we built an action map
              to identify five key customer service behaviors that separate
              great customer service from good or standard service. These
              behaviors included not just de-escalating and escalating customer
              issues properly, but also going the extra mile in problem
              resolution, anticipating customer needs, and delivering
              personalized experiences. These critical actions formed the
              backbone of the course design, ensuring that every scenario
              demonstrated how to elevate performance from satisfactory to
              exceptional, aligned with real-world customer interactions.

            <h4>Storyboarding</h4>
            <p>
              I developed a text-based storyboard that utilized the five
              critical actions from the action map. These actions were built
              into branching scenarios, with the correct answers as key actions
              and common mistakes as distractors. I worked closely with the SME
              to ensure each decision had realistic consequences, ensuring the
              training reflected real-life customer service interactions.
            </p>

            of use. It proved especially valuable to students in the early
            stages of language learning, as it eliminated the barriers of
            installing language packs or using external keyboards. Instructors
            in the DCLCP also incorporated it into their classrooms for reading
            and writing exercises, enhancing the overall teaching and learning
            experience.

          <p>
            This project highlighted the importance of developing responsive,
            accessible tools that meet real user needs. The integration of
            interactive features like drawing and erasing allowed for greater
            flexibility and engagement, making the tool a valuable asset for
            both independent learners and classroom instruction. It reinforced
            the importance of designing educational tools with both
            functionality and user experience in mind.
